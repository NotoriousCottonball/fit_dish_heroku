# Fit Dish
### Share Recipes / Eat Healthy

This is a Rails App made by George Pianka for Flatiron School Final Project Section 3 (Ruby/Rails). The application allows the user to create, store, share, and rate Recipes, while easily generating Grocery Lists from Recipes they add to their Menu of Dishes. Users can recommend Healthy Ingredient Substitutions, Create a Menu of Dishes for the Week, and Like Recipes so other users can Find a New Favorite.
